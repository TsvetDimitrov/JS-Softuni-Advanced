// Write a function that determines whether a driver is within the speed limit. You will receive the speed and the area. 
// Each area has a different limit: 
// •	On the motorway the limit is 130 km/h
// •	On the interstate the limit is 90 km/h
// •	In the city the limit is 50 km/h 
// •	Within a residential area the limit is 20 km/h
// If the driver is within the limits, there should be printed speed and the speed limit. 
// `Driving {speed} km/h in a {speed limit} zone`
// If the driver is over the limit, however, your function should print the severity of the infraction and the difference in speeds. 
// `The speed is {difference} km/h faster than the allowed speed of {speed limit} - {status}`
// For speeding up to 20 km/h over the limit, speeding should be printed 
// For speeding up to 40 km/h over the limit, excessive speeding should be printed
// For anything else, reckless driving should be printed
// The input comes as 2 string parameters. The first element is the current speed (number), the second element is the area.
// The output should be printed on the console.
