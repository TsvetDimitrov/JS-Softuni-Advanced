// Write a function that extracts only those numbers that form a non-decreasing subsequence.
//  In other words, you start from the first element and continue to the end of the given array of numbers. 
//  Any number which is LESS THAN the current biggest one is ignored, 
//  alternatively if itâ€™s equal or higher than the current biggest one you set 
//  it as the current biggest one and you continue to the next number. 
// The input comes as an array of numbers.
// The output is the processed array after the filtration, which should be a non-decreasing subsequence. 
// Return the array of numbers.

// The solution is right, but judge gives 80/100. The other solution gives 100/100
