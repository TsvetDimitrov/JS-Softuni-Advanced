// Write a program that assembles a car by given requirements out of existing components. 
// The client will place an order in the form of an object describing the car. 
// You need to determine which parts to use to fulfil the clientâ€™s order. You have the following parts in storage:
// An engine has power (given in horsepower) and volume (given in cubic centimeters). 
// Both of these values are numbers. When selecting an engine, pick the smallest possible that still meets the requirements.
// Small engine: { power: 90, volume: 1800 }
// Normal engine: { power: 120, volume: 2400 }
// Monster engine: { power: 200, volume: 3500 }
// A carriage has a type and color. Both of these values are strings. You have two types of carriages in storage and can paint it any color.
// Hatchback: { type: 'hatchback', color: <as required> }
// Coupe: { type: 'coupe', color: <as required> }
// The wheels will be represented by an array of 4 numbers, each number represents the diameter of the wheel in inches.
//  The size can only be an odd number. Round down any requirements you receive to the nearest odd number. 
// Input
// You will receive an object as an argument to your function. The format will be as follows:
// { model: <model name>,
//   power: <minimum power>,
//   color: <color>,
//   carriage: <carriage type>,
//   wheelsize: <size> }
// Output
// Return the resulting car object as a result of your function. See the examples for details.
